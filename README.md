# Predicting Housing Prices Using Linear Regression
This project makes used of pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels and scikit-learn libraries to implement a linear regression model to predict house prices accross USA.
Exploratory data analysis has been done to confirm our assumptions before implementing linear regression. After the model has been fitted, it has been evaluated using R^2, Mean Square
Error and plotting distribution plots.

The R^2 comes out to be 0.91, which indicates that our model is a good fit.

The data is taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/vedavyasv/usa-housing?select=USA_Housing.csv
